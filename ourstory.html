                    <p class="intro_text">Walter Whittard was never the sort to compromise. At the age of 17 he quit the family leather business out of frustration with his father’s way of running things, and took a job with a tea trader in London’s bustling city centre.<br><br> Eight years later – aged just 25 – he opened his own shop in bustling Fleet Street, with a simple philosophy: to “buy the best”.

                    <p class="intro_text">It wasn’t long before Walter started to make a name for himself. In 1892, a “Lady L” from Cheltenham wrote to the store that “We like the tea very much, and have recommended it to our friends.” Another customer was similarly impressed: “I received the tea safely, and am much pleased with its quality, it is very good indeed, and I shall recommend it to my friends. The tea however recommends itself.”

The war had unleashed hell on London, and for a while it looked as though Whittard was finished for good – but it would take more than that to kill the brothers’ resolve.

                    <p class="intro_text ">After Whittard lost its warehouse to the blitz, Dick and Hugh quickly set about finding a new warehouse nearby. It wasn’t long before they decided to up sticks and move their entire business – the shop, headquarters, warehouse and coffee roastery – to Chelsea, settling on a rather grand-looking building at 111 Fulham Road.

                    <p class="intro_text ">
                        The new premises presented new challenges, as well as opportunities. The brothers couldn’t get their hands on a new tea blending machine until 1944, so for over three years all blending was done on the floor of the warehouse using special wooden shovels. But they had inherited their father’s eye for quality – and rationing presented a new opportunity, with plenty of customers eager to nominate Whittard of Chelsea as their dedicated tea suppliers.

                    <p class="intro_text ">In 1967, Walter’s son Hugh Whittard was killed along with 48 others when a train came off its rails at Hither Green. It was a serious blow to his brother Dick, who ran the business alone for another five years before handing over the reins – though he was still called in for consultation. Dick died on the 20th July 1985 – just under a century after his father first set up shop.
